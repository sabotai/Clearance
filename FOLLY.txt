FOLLY

Gamifying the meaninglessness of life

reflects upon our tendency to frame things through arbitrarily crafted systems to help rationalize our desires and existance

the impossible game

Folly is a simple existential endurance game, a futile quest for larger numbers before the inevitable face of death.  modeled as a simplification of life into a basic game involving meaningless choices that all converge into simply playing the game we are all mindlessly compelled to play, one that we know we cannot possibly win.  From this distant and disinterested perspective, all of our daily choices, large and small, and any perceived evidence of free-will converging upon the actuality of a need to survive in any form possible.

Our finite journey of acquisition, larger numbers and repetitious consumption rages on with no apparent ultimate purpose. We /buy time/ with our actions, participating in the game by delaying our inevitable mortality.  How does the qualitative value of experience factor into our socially programmed need for progressive quanitification?  In the end, we have nothing to show, for we are not.

Folly is an existential endurance game, a futile quest for larger numbers before the inevitable face of death.  Taking a distant and disinterested perspective, Folly takes perverse humor from the fervor with which we play the game, questioning the cumulative value of our individual choices, identity and experience.  What is the relationship between our qualitative experiences and our socially programmed need for progressive quantification?

As ultimately irrational creatures, we seem forever driven to acquisition and repetitious consumption, playing a game we cannot possibly win, all of our arbitrary decisions convergent upon the impossible desire to exist outside of time.  In the end, we have nothing to show, for we are not.
